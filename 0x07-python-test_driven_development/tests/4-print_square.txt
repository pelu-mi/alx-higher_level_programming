============================
How to use 4-print_square.py
============================

This module defines a function ``print_square(size)``. This function prints
a square of dimensions equal to size.

Usage
=====

``print_square(...)`` prints a square of the dimensions passed to it. The
value passed should be a positive integer or zero for it to work.


Integers
========

First we import the function.

::

>>> print_square = __import__('4-print_square').print_square


This function works as expected with positive integers and 0

::

>>> print_square(3)
###
###
###
>>> print_square(1)
#
>>> print_square(0)


Non-integers
============

The function does not work with floats, both positive and negative

::

>>> print_square(-0.1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: size must be an integer
>>> print_square(1.0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: size must be an integer


It also does not work with other non-int types

::

>>> print_square("")
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: size must be an integer


If the value is negative, a ValueError is raised

::

>>> print_square(-2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
ValueError: size must be >= 0


If there is no argument, a TypeError is raised

::

>>> print_square()
Traceback (most recent call last):
TypeError: print_square() missing 1 required positional argument: 'size'
